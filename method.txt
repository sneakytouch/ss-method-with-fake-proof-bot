So basically this is the OTP ( one time password ) method, you dm the user and accuse them of scamming or some shit. Which you use my fake proof bot for. 

So once they are screensharing, tell them to go their email and look around there a little, once they find there email. screenshot nd write the email on https://www.roblox.com/login "Email me a one time code", WHILE THEY STILL ARE screensharing, then look at there screenshare nd a one time code should be there, copy nd paste it nd boom ur in lmao


How to setup fake proof is basically just download python, use pip to install requests, discord.py==1.7.3 and discord==1.7.3 and then open main.py and enter the token and channel id nd then run main.py and your started lol.


For help add me: touch#1140
